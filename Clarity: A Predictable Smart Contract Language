 

Stacks smart contracts are written in Clarity, a decidable, interpreted language.

Clarity’s core properties:

No compiler (what you read is what executes)

No unbounded loops

Explicit error handling

Static type checking

Safer by design than EVM languages

These properties make Clarity ideal for high-assurance contracts.

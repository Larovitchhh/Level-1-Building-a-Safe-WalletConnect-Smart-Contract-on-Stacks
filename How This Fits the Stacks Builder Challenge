This Level 1 contract is ideal for builder challenges because it:

Generates real on-chain transactions

Is WalletConnect compatible

Encourages repeated interactions

Is easy to integrate in a frontend

Can be deployed on testnet or mainnet

It is intentionally simple — later levels will add complexity.

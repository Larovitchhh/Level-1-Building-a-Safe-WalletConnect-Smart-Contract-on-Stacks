Level 1 — Building a Safe WalletConnect Smart Contract on Stacks
Series: Daily Smart Contracts on Stacks
Level: 1 (Foundations)
Goal: Safe on-chain interaction using WalletConnect + Clarity

Introduction

This article is the first entry (Level 1) in a daily series focused on building progressively more complex smart contracts on Stacks.
At Level 1, the objective is correctness, safety, and understanding fundamentals, not complexity.

We introduce a minimal but production-safe smart contract that allows users to send STX tips, designed to be called from a WalletConnect-enabled frontend.

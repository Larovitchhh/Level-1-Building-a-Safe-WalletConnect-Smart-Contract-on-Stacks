This contract avoids common Clarity pitfalls:

❌ No match with mismatched return types

❌ No unchecked transfers

❌ No implicit failures

Instead, it uses:

asserts! for validation

Explicit error codes

Deterministic execution paths

Clear separation of state updates

Failures occur before any STX is transferred.
